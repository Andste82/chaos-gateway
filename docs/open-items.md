# Phase 1 audit and open items

Date: 2026-10-04. Audited against `main` at `c4d51d3` (M6b merged) and `docs/plan.md` §5 Phase 1 (M1–M6b).
Closed: 2026-10-05, work package 12.

## Result

**Phase 1 is complete.** Every milestone delivers its scope, every test the plan lists exists and
passes, and every item this audit found — all 11 "Suggested work packages" plus the 13 small items
decided on 2026-10-04 but never bundled into one (work package 12: one-line doc/spec edits, CI action
version bumps, a scheduled-nightly confirmation, and three small real gaps — `internal/linkexport`'s
unit tests, the anti-lockout check's SSH connection, and the cloud-image signature check) — is
closed. CI on `main` is green.

| Milestone | Verdict |
|---|---|
| M0 (spikes, docs) | done |
| M1 Repository, CI, testbed | done |
| M2 Domain model, persistence | done |
| M3 Executor | done |
| M4 Compiler, preview, safe apply | done |
| M4b WireGuard | done |
| M4c Dynamic routing | done |
| M5 REST API | done |
| M5b Appliance harness | done |
| M6a DHCP, devices | done |
| M6b DNS, service namespace | done |
| Cross-cutting | done |

### Why items stayed open

Every item carries a reason:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `forgotten` | Simply not done, although the plan or the spec asks for it. |
| `partial` | Started but incomplete. |
| `test-gap` | The code exists, but the test the plan asks for is missing or weak. |
| `plan-error` | The plan is wrong, contradictory, outdated or underspecified. The task says what the plan should say. |
| `deferred` | Consciously moved; the item says where it was documented, or that the target milestone does not mention it yet. |
| `env-limit` | Cannot be done in the development environment (no Docker daemon, no KVM, no privileges on the VPS). It needs CI, the nightly appliance job, or real hardware. |
| `needs-decision` | The maintainer has to choose. The options and a recommendation are given. |

The most common causes are:

- **Forgotten follow-ups that the milestone PR announced.** Examples: "wire up retention in M5", "pinned Kea", "conntrack events".
- **Plan text that the implementation overtook.** Examples: Q1 still open although hosted KVM runners work, `uidrange` replaced by the service namespace, the testbed topology, the `wg` tool.
- **Behaviour that is only observable on a real kernel or in containers,** which the dev environment cannot run: BIRD external mode, Babel, the Kea/BIRD/DNS containers.

## How to work on this file (instructions for the agent)

1. **Branching and commits.**
   - Branch from `main` per work package below, e.g. `phase1-fix-routing`.
   - Commit messages and all written text in English.
   - No AI attribution of any kind in commits, PRs or issues (no `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with").
   - Commit as the repository's git user.
2. **Decisions.** All open questions of Phase 1 were decided on 2026-10-04 (table below, and in each item's "Needs maintainer" line). Implement the decided option. Where it differs from the recommendation, the task was rewritten to match the decision. The Phase 2 items (M7 to M11) were decided on 2026-10-11: the tables under "Phase 2 open items" list them and the items closed with them; one item stays open, a hardware measurement for H1.
3. **Test levels.**
   - **Local:** unit tests (`make test`, `go test ./internal/...`), lint (`make lint`), `make check-generated`.
   - **CI only:** tests with build tag `testbed` (levels 1 and 1b; they need network namespaces, which the dev container lacks) and `appliance` (nightly job, needs KVM).
   - For those, push the branch, open a PR, and watch `gh pr checks <n> --watch`.
   - Read failures with `gh run view <run> --log-failed`.
   - When a testbed test fails without a clear reason, add diagnostics to the test (nft ruleset, routes, sockets) and push again; that is how M6b was debugged.
4. **Toolchain.**
   - Generated code: after editing `api/openapi.yaml`, run `make generate` and commit the generated files; CI runs `make check-spec check-generated check-clients`.
   - Formatting: run `gofmt` (CI lint fails on it) and keep `make lint` at 0 issues.
5. **Updating this file.** When an item is done, delete its block here in the same PR and mention the item id in the commit message. Keep the tables in "Result" up to date.
6. **Plan changes.** Edit `docs/plan.md` only where an item says so (`plan-error` tasks).

## Suggested work packages

Ordered by value. Each package is one branch and one PR, and stays green in CI.

1. **Routing fixes** (done, `phase1-routing-fixes`): M4c-01 (high), M4b-01, M4b-02, M4c-03, M4c-06, M4c-08, M4c-09, M4c-13, M4c-14, M4c-15.
2. **Deployment pinning and health** (done, `phase1-deploy-pin-health`):
   - M6a-01 and M4c-17 (pin Kea and BIRD);
   - M6b-05 and M4-01 (health of the managed services and the supervisor);
   - M6a-25, M4c-07, M5b-04, M5b-01 (run the nightly job on main).
3. **API correctness** (done, `phase1-api-correctness`): M5-01, M5-04, M5-05, M5-06, M5-09, M5-11 to M5-22, M5-24.
4. **Devices and flows** (done, `phase1-devices-flows`; M6a-03 was only narrowed here and closed outright by package 11, M6a-07's doc part closed by package 9; M6a-22 closed outright once M6b-08 added certificate pinning): M6a-02, M6a-03, M6a-05, M6a-06, M6a-07 (limiter part), M6a-08, M6a-11, M6a-13 to M6a-22.
5. **Service namespace hardening** (done, `phase1-svcns-hardening`): M6b-01, M6b-03, M6b-04, M6b-06, M6b-07, M6b-08, M6b-10.

9. **Plan and docs sync** (done, one commit directly on `main`; M6a-04 was listed here originally but excluded, since its decision was to implement conntrack events in code, see package 11):
   - all `plan-error` items once their decisions are made: M1-01, M1-06, M1-10, M3-06, M4-09, M4b-03, M4b-07, M4b-08, M4c-11, M4c-16, M5-07, M5-23, M6a-07 (doc part), M6a-10, M6a-12, M6a-23, M6a-24, M6b-04 (M7 test), M6b-11;
   - doc items M0-01, M0-02, M3-07, M4-08, M4b-06, M6b-09, CC-01, CC-02.

11. **Conntrack events** (done, `phase1-conntrack-events`): M6a-04, then the rates of M6a-03 on top of it.
12. **Final cleanup** (done, `phase1-final-cleanup`): the 13 items decided on 2026-10-04 but never bundled above — CC-03, CC-05, CC-06, M0-03, M2-03, M2-08, M3-04, M4-02, M4-07, M4c-10, M5b-02, M5b-03, M6b-12.

## Cross-cutting

Removed from the old list: CC-01, CC-02 (closed in work package 9). CC-03 (`internal/linkexport` unit
tests) — closed with `internal/linkexport/linkexport_test.go`, covering a link with static routes
(the remote `.conf`: peer, endpoint, AllowedIPs; the BIRD snippet against a real `bird -p`) and the
no-routing error case. CC-04 (closed in work package 8). CC-05 (Node 20 deprecation warnings) —
every action in `.github/workflows/*.yml` bumped to its current major version (checkout v7, setup-go
v7, setup-node v7, setup-python v7, upload-artifact v7, cache v6, the Docker actions v4-v7); checked
each for breaking input changes against what this repo actually passes, none apply. CC-06 (the
scheduled nightly on `main`) — a `schedule`-triggered run exists and is green (run 37189011437,
2026-10-04T08:28:05Z); the workaround note in M5b-01 is now historical. Also fixed in passing: the
doc comment of `vmrun.GuestOptions` mentioned a `Verbose` field that does not exist
(`internal/testbed/vmrun/guest.go`).

## M0 (spikes, plan, docs)

Removed from the old list: "Devcontainer rebuild never verified" — wrong: CI builds `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` on every run (jobs `testbed-vm`, `testbed-privileged`); only the `start.sh rebuild` wrapper is untested. "Q1 evidence outdated" moved to M1-01, "Nightly kernel matrix" to M1-02. M0-03 (ESP32 QEMU fork) — the candidate sentence removed from plan.md §4.5; firmware tests keep using real devices.

## M1 (repository, CI, testbed)

Verdict: done. The scope is delivered, the M1 tests pass in CI, and the plan/doc drift (Q1/D33, the runner's exit code wording, the repository layout) is fixed.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Go module, Vue skeleton, oapi-codegen, Orval, openapi-python-client | done | `go.mod`, `web/`, `api/oapi-codegen-*.yaml`, `web/orval.config.ts`, Makefile `generate-python` |
| CI check: spec validates, examples validate, generated code compiles | done (validation, no style linter) | `make check-spec`, `check-generated`, `check-clients`; ci.yml level0 |
| Makefile, golangci-lint, go test -race, Vitest, Playwright skeleton | done | Makefile, `.golangci.yml`, `web/src/App.test.ts`, `web/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` |
| CI levels 0, 1b and 1 in hosted CI; `make test-vm` on the VPS before a merge | done | ci.yml; nightly kernel matrix (`testbed-matrix`) and weekly emulated check (`weekly.yml`) |
| Level 1 job in hosted CI | done | ci.yml `testbed-privileged` |
| `internal/testbed` (two networks, bridges, management default route) | done | `internal/testbed/topology.go`; `TestDefaultTopology` |
| Level 1b runner (one VM, rw share, no terminal) | done | `internal/testbed/vmrun` |
| Devcontainer with tools and stock kernels | done (GA kernels; nightly matrix runs each) | `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`; `nightly.yml` `testbed-matrix` |
| Injectable clock | done | `internal/clock` |
| arm64 image build | done | ci.yml `arm64` |
| Decision where KVM tests run (Q1) | done | D33 (plan §7.1) |
| Shared module preflight | done | `internal/preflight`; `TestHostSetupLoadsExactlyTheModulesOfThePreflight` |
| T: ping through a forwarding namespace in level 1b | done (CI) | `TestClientPingsServerThroughPlainForwardingGateway` |
| T: netem delay visible | done (CI) | `TestNetemDelayIsVisible` |
| T: runner returns the tests' exit code | done | `TestRunVMExitCodes` |
| T: same test in a privileged container | done (CI) | ci.yml `testbed-privileged` |

## M2 (domain model, persistence)

Verdict: done. Every scope and test item is implemented and tested.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Domain model from generated types | done | `internal/model/model.gen.go`, `domain.OverlayKey`, `NewOverlay` |
| Strict decoding | done | `domain/decode.go`; `TestUnknownFieldsInAConfigurationAreRejected`, `TestDuplicateKeysInAJSONDocumentAreRejected` |
| Rules the schema cannot express | done | `validate*.go` |
| Observed-state model | done | `domain/observed.go` |
| Precedence per family, overlays first | done | `domain/resolve.go`; `TestOverlaysWinWhateverTheLevel` |
| Atomic persistence, revisions with diff, schema versions | done | `store/files.go`, `store.Diff`, `store/migrate.go` |
| T: validation, precedence rows, E1–E8/E12, round-trip, corrupted files, examples, pointers and codes | done | `TestEveryPrecedenceLevel…`, `TestE1…`–`TestE12…`, corrupt_test.go, crash_test.go, `TestEveryExampleFileIsCheckedByTheDomain` |
| Retention 200 revisions (§3.6) | done | `internal/engine/owner.go` `pruneRevisions`; `TestCommittedRevisionsArePrunedToTheRetention` |

Removed from the old list: M2-03 ("configured address beats a lease") — documented as intended in
plan.md §2.3 and docs/development.md ("DHCP and devices"); the code's existing, stronger behaviour is
unchanged. M2-08 (persistence layout vs. plan §3.6) — plan.md §3.6 rewritten to the real current
paths (`/var/lib/chaosgw/{state,secrets,api,service}`, revision status files, `audit.jsonl`); the
switch to bind mounts at these paths is now in the M28 scope.

## M3 (executor and state reader)

Verdict: done. All scope and test items exist.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Typed closed operations, argument arrays, fixed paths, namespace targeting | done | `internal/executor/op.go`, `runner.go`; `TestRunnerUsesOnlyFixedAbsolutePaths`, `TestNamespaceIsPassedToEveryCommand` |
| Parsers `ip -j`, `nft -j`, `tc -j` | done | `internal/linux`; `parse_test.go` |
| Unix socket, version handshake, `SO_PEERCRED` | done | `proto.go`, `server.go`; `TestPeerCredentialsAreChecked`, version-mismatch tests |
| Scope: nft only `inet chaosgw`; routing only own tables/rules | done | `validate.go`; testbed `TestNftablesApplyIsAtomicAndScoped`, `TestExecutorCannotDeleteForeignRulesOrRoutes` |
| Scope: tc only assigned interfaces **and the uplink qdisc** | done | `os_owned` (M3-01); `TestOSOwnedInterfacesTakeOnlyTrafficControlRoutesAndOffloads` |
| Single `DOCKER-USER` operation | done | `DockerUser`; `TestDockerUserAcceptRulesAreMaintained` |
| Serialized queue with identity priority | done | `exec.go`; `TestIdentityUpdatesGoBeforeQueuedPlansAndNeverRunConcurrently` |
| Container hardening profile | done | `deploy/compose.executor.yaml`; `TestExecutorContainerHardeningProfile` |
| T: integration reads the gateway namespace; out-of-scope rejected; fuzz 5 min/nightly; version mismatch | done | testbed `TestExecutorReadsTheGatewayNamespace`; `TestDecodeRejects`; `FuzzDecode`/`FuzzFrame`, Makefile, nightly.yml |

Removed from the old list: M3-04 (executor generation restarts at 0) — documented as per-process,
not persistent, on `Outcome.Generation` itself (`internal/executor/exec.go`); the persisted
generation lives in the engine (M5-01).

## M4 (compiler, preview, safe apply)

Verdict: done. All scope and test items exist and pass.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Uplink selection, followed via netlink | done | `compile.go`, `internal/observer`; testbed `TestTheEngineFollowsTheUplinkThroughNetlinkEvents` |
| Bridges, table 100, forwarding, masquerade, gateway protection, matrix default, IPv6 block, offloads, DOCKER-USER | done | `compile.go`, `rules.go`; unit tests and testbed `TestGatewayProtection`, `TestIPv6IsBlockedOnTestNetworks`, `TestDockerUserAcceptLetsTestTrafficThroughDockersForwardPolicy` |
| nft layout (dynamic sets survive, removed objects deleted, hashed names), generation and verify | done | `compiler/nft.go`, `apply/verify.go`; `TestDynamicSetsAndCountersSurviveEveryApply`, `TestAGenerationThatDoesNotMatchIsReported` |
| Preview, apply, rollback, commit-confirm, anti-lockout, assignment by MAC, `chaosgw apply --file` | done | `engine/api.go`, `owner.go`, `lockout.go`, `compiler/host.go`, `cmd/chaosgw/apply.go` |
| State owner, snapshots, apply loop (§3.11) | done | owner.go, applyloop.go |
| Supervisor helper | done | used by the engine; `Engine.Health()` read by `GetHealth` |
| goleak in goroutine packages | done (gap: `internal/appliance`, see M5b-05) | TestMain in executor, engine, observer, supervisor, cmd/chaosgw, api, clock, dnsproxy, testbed |
| T: golden, client reaches server, protection, management route, verify manipulation, injected failure, rollback, set change, uplink change, immutable snapshots, observer during apply | done | see the test names in `internal/{compiler,apply,engine}` |
| T: preview matches applied state | done | `TestPreviewShowsTheChangeAndChangesNothing` compares the previewed plan and diff with what `apply.BuildPlan`/`apply.Diff` build from the same pre-apply state |

Removed from the old list: "tc tokens allow `/` and `..`" — wrong: `..` is rejected (`internal/executor/validate.go:423`, test "tc path traversal token"). "Supervisor helper deferred to M8a" (Covered later) — wrong: the supervisor exists and is used; only the reader pool and time stamps go to M8a, overlay removal on stop to M27. M4-02 (management matrix endpoint vs. spec) — the spec's description now follows the code
(`Management.allowed_sources`, or the interface subnet when none are given). M4-07 (`apply --file`
without `--state-dir` has no rollback) — now warns on stderr, asserted in `TestApplyFileFailures`.

## M4b (WireGuard networks and clients)

Verdict: done. All plan tests exist and passed in CI (run 37147106957); two formerly open items (PSK verify by presence only, the first poll announcing online peers) are accepted as documented behaviour (docs/development.md).

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Hub and link as network type, `wg` tool, clients with client networks, reachable lists, static routes, policy rules | done | `internal/compiler/wireguard.go`; `TestWireGuardRoutesAndRules`; testbed `TestLocalDeviceReachesAClientNetworkWithoutNATAndTheReverseNeedsTheMatrix`, `TestALinkWithStaticRoutesCarriesTrafficToTheRemoteSite` |
| Routed without NAT to test networks | done | testbed `integration_wg_test.go:251,275,304` |
| Masqueraded towards the uplink | done | `TestMasqueradeTowardsTheUplinkOnlyAndForTheNetworksBehindClients` (a link matches by interface, covering learned routes too); testbed `TestAClientNetworkIsMasqueradedTowardsTheUplink` |
| Keys, preshared keys, export once, `.conf`/QR/zip | done | `internal/wireguard/*_test.go`; `TestQRCodesAndNetworkExports` |
| Client status and events, clients as devices, role management, MSS clamp, MTU | done | `engine/wireguard.go`; testbed `TestDisablingAClientStopsItsHandshakeAndEmitsTheEvent`, `TestRolesDecideWhoReachesTheControlPlane`, `TestTheMSSIsClampedOnTheTunnel` |
| T: export works in a fresh namespace, QR decodes, keys never in logs, re-apply keeps the tunnel | done | `TestPrivateKeysStayOutOfStoreSnapshotAndLogsAndAReapplyKeepsTheTunnel` |

## M4c (dynamic routing, BIRD)

Verdict: done. The high bug (external mode) is fixed; every scope and test item exists and passes.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| BIRD instance, own config/socket/container | done | `deploy/compose.bird.yaml`, `executor/exec.go:662-758` |
| BGP, OSPFv2 | done | testbed `TestThreeSitesWithBGPAndOSPFLearnRoutesOnlyIntoTheOwnTable` (now also exercises the OSPF import filter) |
| Babel | done | the link-local address Babel needs is assigned to the WireGuard interface (M4c-05); testbed `TestBabelOverAWireGuardLink` |
| Static, router id/ASN/neighbors/areas/timers, announcements | done | `compiler/routing.go`; `TestTheBirdConfigurationFollowsTheModel` |
| Import filters | done | `bird/render.go`; the management subnet is protected with explicit `allowed_sources` too, and `allow_default` is honored with an allowed list |
| Export only into own tables | done for table 100 and, since M10, the PMTU mirror tables | `TestLearnedRoutesAreExportedIntoThePMTUMirrorTablesToo` |
| `bird -p` + `birdc configure` part of the revision | done | `executor/exec.go:705-758`, `apply/bird.go` |
| …and of preview/diff | done | `Preview.linux.bird` and `.wireguard` are filled |
| Custom snippets | done | `bird/lexical.go` |
| External mode | done | fixed (RTS_INHERIT, not RTS_PIPE); `TestExternalModeImportsAnotherDaemonsTable` |
| Neighbor and route status and events | done | `routing_session_changed` and `routing_routes_changed`; `TestRouteCountChangesAreEvents` |
| Remote-side snippet in link exports | done | `bird/remote.go`, `internal/linkexport`, API `format=bird` |
| T: three sites, learned only into own tables, filters (BGP and OSPF), max-prefix, link down, withdrawal, config change, invalid snippet, failed apply, confirm-timeout rollback | done | see the M4c test names in `internal/engine`, `internal/apply` |

Removed from the old list: M4c-10 (the preview does not show the effective route for a destination)
— moved to M8a's `/explain` scope; plan.md §2.2.2 now says "shown by explain" instead of promising
it in the preview.

## M5 (REST API v1)

Verdict: done. Every scope and test item exists and all 41 `x-milestone: M5` operations have handlers.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| problem+json, UUID or name in paths, cursor pagination, ETag/If-Match/428, merge-patch candidates, idempotency keys | done | `internal/api/{problem,helpers,middleware,revisions,idempotency}.go`; `TestProblemsAreProblemJSON`, `TestIdempotencyKeys` |
| SSE with ids, replay, keepalive | done | `events.go`, `engine/events.go`; a restart or an expired replay window sends a synthetic `events_lost` event (M5-02) |
| Generation (state, header, SSE `applied`) | done | persisted across restarts (`engine.Config.GenerationFile`); `TestGenerationContinuesAfterRestart`, `TestGenerationSurvivesAnAPIRestart` |
| Capabilities, candidate model, sessions + CSRF, hashed tokens with scopes, setup token | done | `system.go`, `revisions.go`, `auth/auth.go`; `TestLoginSessionCSRFAndLogout`, `TestTokenScopesAndTheirLifecycle` |
| Setup "applies with commit-confirm" (spec `POST /setup`) | done | `engine.ApplyOptions.ForceConfirm` (M5-03); `TestTheSetupWaitsForConfirmation`, `TestAnUnconfirmedSetupIsRolledBackAndReopened` |
| Admin password reset | done | `cmd/chaosgw/admin.go`: audited, interactive prompt |
| UI/API bound to the management network after setup | done | `cmd/chaosgw/api.go`: also excludes test networks before setup; the loopback binding for the container health check is documented (plan §2.16) |
| Audit log | done | `internal/audit`: retention, failure surfaced as unhealthy, system-originated rollbacks audited |
| T: contract tests, clients compile, E2E testbed, conflicts, confirm_pending, SSE reconnect, slow subscriber, concurrent applies | done | `harness_test.go` `checkContract` (now validates requests and SSE events too), `make check-clients`, `e2e_test.go`, `revisions_test.go`, `events_test.go` |

## M5b (appliance VM harness, level 2)

Verdict: done. Scope done; the level-2 smoke is green with the current deploy config (24.04 and 26.04, three and two ports, run 37171706227, on branch `phase1-deploy-pin-health`, which also added BIRD to the deployment).

Removed from the old list: M5b-02 (anti-lockout check reused the old SSH connection) — `VM.DialFresh`
opens a brand new connection and runs `true` over it; the client namespace's inability to reach SSH
on the gateway's LAN address is asserted alongside it (real verification needs the nightly appliance
job). M5b-03 (cloud image checksums not signature-verified) — `Fetch` now checks `SHA256SUMS.gpg`
against Ubuntu's own signing key with `gpgv` before trusting `SHA256SUMS` at all.

(Q1 and the level-2 wording of the plan: see M1-01.)

## M6a (DHCP and device discovery)

Verdict: done. Every plan test exists (testbed tests passed in CI); conntrack is followed through events with a polling fallback, and `started_at` is parsed and exposed.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Kea container, pinned version | done | `deploy/Dockerfile`, `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (`ARG KEA_VERSION`) |
| One subnet per network, pools, reservations via `config-set`, DHCP on/off | done | `internal/compiler/dhcp.go`, `internal/kea`; `TestTheClientDrivesARealKea`; testbed `TestDhcpOffOnOneNetworkLeavesItSilent` |
| Lease events via `run_script` | done | `cmd/chaosgw/keahook.go`, `api/devices.go:312`; `TestACommittedHookCarriesEveryLease`; a Unix datagram socket to the API, HTTP only as a fallback, not a fork per lease (M6a-09) |
| Flow observer on conntrack events | done | `Engine.FollowConntrack` watches `conntrack -E` through the executor's `Watch`/`Event` frames, debounced into `TriggerObserve`; the 1 s poll is a fallback after 10 s without a watch (M6a-04) |
| Flows API | done | `started_at` parsed from `conntrack -o ktimestamp`'s `start=` field (`nf_conntrack_timestamp`), exposed as `Flow.StartedAt`/`started_at` (M6a-03); the real kernel field format still needs confirming once this runs in CI (see "Deviations" in the merged PR) |
| Discovery from leases, neighbors, conntrack, WG clients | done | discovery by address also covers a LAN network's own downstream routes |
| Identity events, incremental updates | done | `owner.go`, `applyloop.go`; `device_identity_changed` carries its generation |
| Manual device merge | done (as a revision per the spec) | `domain/observed.go:278`; moving overlays to the configured device waits for M8a (plan.md updated) |
| Devices API | done | `upload_bps`, `download_bps`, `flows_active` |
| §3.11 identity before plans | done | `TestIdentityUpdatesGoBeforeQueuedPlansAndNeverRunConcurrently` |
| T: lease, MAC/IP, reservation, DHCP off, discovered vs configured, identity within 1 s, flows | done | `internal/engine/integration_dhcp_test.go` |
| T: burst debounced into one identity update | done | `TestABurstOfNeighborChangesIsOneIdentityUpdate` |

Removed from the old list: M6a-03 (`started_at` needs a verified conntrack timestamp format) and M6a-04 (conntrack polled, not followed through events) — both closed by `phase1-conntrack-events` (work package 11), which added `Engine.FollowConntrack` watching `conntrack -E` through a new executor `Watch`/`Event` frame pair, debounced into `TriggerObserve` with the 1 s poll kept as a 10 s fallback, and parses `Flow.StartedAt`/API `started_at` from `conntrack -o ktimestamp`'s `start=` field. "Only the first MAC is reserved" — the spec defines `fixed_ip` as "DHCP reservation for the device's first MAC" (openapi.yaml:2752). "Executor priority only unit-tested" — plan §3.11 prescribes exactly that (fake-executor test). "Online ignores leases" → M6a-24.

## M6b (DNS proxy and service namespace)

Verdict: done. Scope and tests exist and the DNS testbed test passed in CI.

| Plan item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Holder `svcns`, `svc0` pair, table 102 with prohibit fallback | done | `cmd/chaosgw/svcns.go`, `compiler/service.go`, `apply/service_test.go`; the holder's PID is checked against the netns inode it reported, so a reused PID is refused |
| Re-attach on holder change | done | `engine/service.go` (WatchService), `executor/exec.go`; `TestAHolderThatRestartsIsNoticedAndTheNamespaceReplaced` (simulated kernel), `TestAHolderRestartIsHealedWithoutHelp` (real holder process) |
| A dead holder degrades instead of failing every apply | done | `ServiceHealth.HolderExists` distinguishes dead from merely unattached (M6b-02); `engine.Snapshot.ServiceError`; `TestADeadHolderDoesNotBlockARevisionApply` |
| Services leave a stale namespace (§3.8, risk 35) | done | `dnsproxy.WatchNamespace`; `chaosgw dns --namespace-check` |
| DNAT for LAN and WG gateway addresses, UDP+TCP | done | `compiler/service.go`; testbed `TestDNSThroughTheServiceNamespace` |
| Forwarding, caching, AAAA removal, query log, registration | done | `internal/dnsproxy`, `api/dns.go`; an AAAA query of a missing name is NXDOMAIN, SVCB/HTTPS `ipv6hint` is stripped too |
| Coexistence with systemd-resolved | done | tested |
| Upstream from the host | done, limits documented | per-link resolvers are not distinguished (docs/development.md) |
| Managed services report health (§2.14, Health enum `kea`/`svcns`/`dns`) | done | `internal/api/system.go` GetHealth |
| Proxy and Kea hook verify the API's certificate | done | `internal/api.PublishCertificate`, `--api-cert-file`/`CHAOSGW_API_CERT` |
| T: LAN and WG client over UDP and TCP; restart of the proxy | done | `e2e_dns_test.go` |
| T: no bind on 127.0.0.53, resolved keeps working | done | |
| T: holder restart healed | done | |
| T: fail closed | done | named in the plan's M7 test list |

Removed from the old list: "Query log in memory only" — the plan asks only for `/dns/queries` with a device filter (§2.13); persistence is not required. M6b-12 (`ui_port` spec default vs. the code) —
replaced the stale `default: 443` with a description naming the real default (the API's own port,
8443 in the shipped compose files).

## Covered later

These are open but scheduled in a later milestone of docs/plan.md §5; they are not Phase 1 work. Items whose target milestone does not mention them yet are in the lists above (with a task to add them to that milestone).

| M0: `image.yml` has never run (ghcr push, release tags) | M28 |
| M0: persistent faults for DNS, TLS, DHCP and profile activations (D31) | M39 |
| M0: three-way merge, NFLOG capture, extra diagnostics, drift detection, .deb (D28) | M38 |
| Stubs: `chaosgw tls`, `chaosctl` beyond `version` | M21, M18 |
| Image holds only `chaosgw`/`chaosctl` and executor tools; full image with Kea, tcpdump, mitmproxy | M28 |
| ~~Identity maps (address → device), classification and faults not compiled yet~~ — done in M7, M8a, M8b | M7, M8a, M8b |
| ~~Reader pool and operation time stamps (M3 deferral)~~ — done in M8a | M8a |

| M6b: TLS responder joins the service namespace | M21 |

## Phase 2 open items

Phase 2 (M7 to M11) produced 42 items: 39 from the first review, and three that the review of M9 and M11 and the first CI runs
added (P2-M9-11, P2-M10-09, P2-M11-05). On 2026-10-11 the maintainer decided 36 of them (first table below): 31 in the first round, then
the three confirmations P2-M7-02, P2-M8b-07 and P2-M11-02 and the two items transferred to the acceptance criteria of M20 and M21 in
`docs/plan.md` (P2-M9-02, P2-M11-01). The decisions are recorded where the behavior is documented: the milestone's section in
`docs/development.md`, the description in `api/openapi.yaml` where the behavior is user-visible, and `docs/plan.md` where the plan said
otherwise. Seven decisions changed behavior and were implemented with them (P2-M9-01, P2-M9-03, P2-M9-04, P2-M9-11, P2-M10-08, P2-M11-03,
P2-M11-05); the others confirmed the interpretation the item had chosen (for P2-M9-11 the second question, the meaning of `uplink`, was
confirmed and documented). P2-M8a-07 was resolved in M9. Five items needed no decision and were closed by work on 2026-10-11 and
2026-10-12 (second table: P2-M8a-06, P2-M8b-02, P2-M8b-04, P2-M8b-08, P2-M10-09). The blocks of all 41 are gone from this file, like
the closed items of Phase 1; the item ids stay as names, since the code and the documents refer to them. One item stays open (below):
P2-M9-06, a hardware measurement for H1, which also carries the arm64 apply-cost measurement left from P2-M8b-04.

### Decisions (made 2026-10-11)

| Item | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| P2-M7-01 | Should M7 write the service-selection mark (bit 20)? | Confirmed: no, it stays deferred to M20/M21, where the real redirect-interaction test is |
| P2-M7-02 | Classification maps keyed by address, not by the identity map's device number | Confirmed: keyed by address (a device that gets a new address changes 6 elements in all maps, `TestAnAddressChangeChangesAHandfulOfElements`); recorded in `docs/development.md` (M8a) |
| P2-M7-03 | Convergence bound of the identity map on a shared CI runner | Confirmed: 3 s on CI, the plan's 1 s is the target on dedicated hardware (H1) |
| P2-M8a-01 | Group and network scopes folded into per-source tables | Confirmed: folded |
| P2-M8a-02 | Packet size, memory budget and link speed of the computed queue limit | Confirmed: 1500 bytes, 256 MiB per interface, never below netem's 1000 packets, 1 Gbit/s as the cap; the link speed from the host stays a later refinement |
| P2-M8a-03 | Unknown addresses of a network share one queue per fault | Confirmed: one per winning fault |
| P2-M8a-04 | The class limit counts the default class and applies to every interface alike | Confirmed |
| P2-M8a-07 | `explain` by rules | Resolved in M9 (`World.AccessDecision`) |
| P2-M8b-01 | A duplicating netem cannot share an interface's tree | Resolved by P2-M10-01 |
| P2-M8b-03 | Make-before-break holds old and new classes at once; its time limits | Confirmed: the three limits as constants, the class limit does not count the waiting classes |
| P2-M8b-05 | Counter epochs are generations and a restart starts a new one | Confirmed |
| P2-M8b-06 | Tolerance for the spread of a jitter and for "no change" | Confirmed: 0.5 to 1.5 times the uniform spread plus 2 ms; median within ±2 ms + 5 % of before and no loss |
| P2-M8b-07 | A burst through a delay fault loses replies in the echo server's own output path on a slow runner | Confirmed: the burst test accounts for the echo server's own output errors (`Icmp.OutErrors`) and the host's receive drops and fails on any packet nothing counts; the burst is not paced |
| P2-M9-01 | An allow rule in the input path | **Changed:** it accepts, so it also opens the gateway's closed ports for its selector; the UI/API port rule for other sources and the anti-lockout rule stand in front of the rules |
| P2-M9-02 | A rule that names a hostname is not compiled before M20 | **Transferred to the plan:** M20's acceptance criteria (`docs/plan.md`) include a drop rule with a hostname destination that blocks the addresses the device resolved; until then the rule stays out of the chain with the warning `hostname_unresolved` |
| P2-M9-03 | The type of a `reject` | **Changed:** chosen per rule with `reject_with` (`port_unreachable` by default, `host_unreachable`, `admin_prohibited`, `no_route`) |
| P2-M9-04 | The network scope and the networks behind a test network's static routes | **Changed:** "network X" includes them, for rules and faults alike |
| P2-M9-05 | Fault counters count packets a rule drops afterwards | Confirmed: left as it is |
| P2-M9-07 | A rule's counter counts new connections only | Confirmed; documented in the spec |
| P2-M9-08 | `lockout_protected` is never produced | Confirmed: commit-confirm is enough, the code stays reserved |
| P2-M9-09 | Access rules select IPv4 only | Confirmed: IPv6 selectors come with M32 |
| P2-M9-10 | What "also cut existing connections" does at its edges | Confirmed |
| P2-M9-11 | Does the two-port guard stand in front of the access rules, and what does the destination `uplink` mean? | **Changed (1):** the guard stands in front of the jump to the access rules (chain `mgmt_guard`), so no rule, an `allow` rule included, opens the management network behind the uplink; only an explicit matrix entry does, and `explain` agrees with the kernel. Confirmed (2): `uplink` keeps its meaning (in no configured network and not in the management prefixes), so learned prefixes (BGP, OSPF) and the service namespace's 169.254.100.0/30 count as uplink; documented in the spec and in `docs/development.md` |
| P2-M10-01 | Duplication as a draw plus a copy on the netdev egress hook | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-02 | When a flapping starts, and a boundary during an apply | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-03 | A rate below 8 bit/s is refused; the phase of a flapping in the API | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-04 | Black hole before the access rules, the route lock, the clamp's headers | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-05 | Directions and peer address of a tunnel fault | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-06 | The WireGuard actions | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-07 | One IFB with a fixed name; the host's ingress qdisc is shared | Confirmed |
| P2-M10-08 | The per-packet delay check of the update test on a loaded runner | **Changed:** the measured stream is at least 200 packets (sent 5 ms apart); the bounds and the rule that none is more than 10 ms outside stay |
| P2-M11-01 | A profile with a DNS or TLS part is stored but cannot be activated before M20 and M21 | **Transferred to the plan:** M20 (`dns`) and M21 (`tls`) lift `domain.unavailableFamilies` family by family, and their acceptance criteria include that such a profile activates and its part competes in its family; until then the activation is refused with `unsupported_feature` |
| P2-M11-02 | Custom profiles only through candidate revisions, no endpoints of their own | Confirmed: no `POST /profiles`; the configuration's `profiles` are created, changed and deleted with a revision |
| P2-M11-03 | The rate of the built-in Bad LTE end to end | **Changed:** a UDP measurement above the rate was added (`TestTheRateOfBadLTEShapesUDPSentAboveItEndToEnd`) |
| P2-M11-04 | The accuracy check of a profile with a rate and a jitter | Confirmed: a bound is enough for the ordered delay |
| P2-M11-05 | A revision that adds a DNS or TLS part to a custom profile that an overlay activates | **Changed:** the revision is refused with `unsupported_feature` naming the profile and the milestone (M20 for `dns`, M21 for `tls`) while the activation exists, as the write of the activation is; without the activation it is accepted |

### Closed by work (2026-10-11 and 2026-10-12)

| Item | Question | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| P2-M8a-06 | An overlay or fault that wins only for a part of its selector is shown as effective | Done on 2026-10-11. The compiler now counts, per fault, the table cells it matches and wins over every source's table (`domain.Table.Coverage`, `compiler.Target.Coverage`), so the API reports a fault, overlay or profile activation that wins only some of its traffic as `partially_overridden`, one that wins all of it as `effective`, and one that wins none as `overridden`. A test checks the coverage cell by cell against `Resolve` on random worlds (`TestTheCoverageOfATableIsWhatResolveSaysCellByCell`), and an API test shows a network fault as `partially_overridden` next to an effective device fault (`TestAFaultThatWinsOnlyAPartOfItsTrafficIsPartiallyOverridden`). A fault that wins no traffic is no longer in `Target.Winners` or the preview's effective list. |
| P2-M8b-02 | Verification cannot see the HTB quantum or the netem distribution table | Done on 2026-10-12, through the first way of its acceptance (no maintainer decision needed): after an engine start a leaf the apply has not written counts as possibly holding a distribution table; an unchanged leaf that is to be uniform is left alone (its queue stays), the first change of that leaf makes it again, and a named table is written in place at the first apply, so a table left from before the start is gone at the first change of the leaf (`TestAfterARestartTheFirstChangeOfALeafDropsTheTableThePreviousRunLeft` on the real kernel, `TestAChangeToAUniformJitterMakesTheLeafAgainOnlyWhereATableMayBe`). The table memory keeps the leaves of the classes that wait for their deletion, so a class wanted again keeps its queue (`TestAnIdThatReturnsBeforeTheDeletionKeepsItsClass`). The HTB quantum turned out to be reported by the kernel (tc prints it with `-d` on 6.8 and 6.17), so the executor now reads classes with `-d` and verify compares the quantum; a quantum changed from outside is found and repaired in place (`TestTheRealKernelShowsAChangedQuantumAndTheApplyRepairsIt`). Not covered (documented in `docs/development.md`): a table written into a leaf while the engine runs, without changing what the listing shows, is replaced only at the next change of that leaf. |
| P2-M8b-04 | The tc state of every assigned interface is read at every apply and every verify | Done on 2026-10-11, except the arm64 measurement, which moved to P2-M9-06 (H1). A state read lists the qdiscs of all interfaces in one tc run and reads the full tc state only of the interfaces holding a tree: an apply with ten assigned interfaces and the tree on three runs tc 20 times to read instead of 38 (`TestAnApplyWithTenAssignedInterfacesListsTheQdiscsOnce`). `ReadHost` (the compiler's input) no longer reads the tc state at all. |
| P2-M8b-08 | The first packets of the first flow of a lab wait about a second on a fast kernel | Done on 2026-10-11. Cause: in the product-test topology Switch1's port q1 has the same interface index as its peer `lan1`, so the kernel's link-watch treats q1's carrier event as non-urgent and leaves the port disabled for up to a second after the topology is built; device C's first ARP request was lost and C's first packets waited for the 1 s retry. The testbed now returns the topology only when every veth end is up and every switch port forwards (`Bed.WaitLinks`, called by `NewDefault`; `TestTheFirstPacketOfEveryDeviceGoesThroughRightAfterTheTopologyIsBuilt`). The warm-up stays as `meetDevices` plus `settleIdentity`, documented: it exists only so the engine has discovered every device before a test compares its compile with the kernel, not for timing. |
| P2-M10-09 | One probe of a stream is not classified while other faults are changed | Done on 2026-10-11. Cause: every apply flushed and refilled the static nft sets and maps in one transaction, and the kernel's interval sets (pipapo, rbtree) can miss lookups during that commit; the new test `TestAFlowKeepsItsClassificationWhileOtherFaultsAreWritten` measured 23 to 122 misses per stream of about 150k on the native runner (6.17) and 7 to 136 on 6.8.0-142. The apply now changes set and map elements by their difference with the kernel listing, which missed none in every native, level-1b and emulated run, and `TestUpdatingOneFaultDoesNotDisturbTheOthers` passed in all six native level-1 runs and both level-1b runs. Known limit (documented): an element whose value changes (traffic that moves to another fault) is still deleted and added in one commit. |

### Items that stay open

### P2-M9-06 The limits of the access rules and the cost of an apply are not measured on small hardware

- Status: new (extended on 2026-10-11 with the arm64 measurement left from P2-M8b-04; both measurements are in the Scope and Tests of plan H1)
- Severity: low
- Reason: env-limit (H1). The compiler refuses more than 1000 rules (overlays included) and more than
  65536 source addresses in all rule sets with `capacity_exceeded`, on every architecture. Rules are
  evaluated for the first packet of each connection only (established traffic is accepted first), so
  the chain is a linear scan per new connection; nothing in the repository measures what 1000 rules
  cost a Raspberry Pi at the connection rates of a test lab. Likewise the cost of an apply was only
  counted in tool runs, not timed on arm64: P2-M8b-04 cut the tc reads of an apply with ten assigned
  interfaces and the tree on three from 38 tool runs to 20 (one qdisc listing of all interfaces,
  `TestAnApplyWithTenAssignedInterfacesListsTheQdiscsOnce`).
- Evidence: `internal/compiler/access.go` (`DefaultRuleLimit`, `MaxRuleElements`); `internal/apply/state.go`
  (`readTC`, `devsWithTree`).
- Task: chosen interpretation — one limit for all architectures (the class limit has two because tc
  classes cost memory and CPU per packet; rules cost per connection). H1 measures new connections per
  second with 1000 rules on the target hardware and sets an ARM64 default if needed, and times an apply
  with ten assigned interfaces (the tree on three) on the arm64 runner against the overlay apply latency of plan §3.10 (≤ 200 ms on a Raspberry Pi 4/5).
- Acceptance: the H1 measurements exist; the rule limit is confirmed or lowered for ARM64, and the apply
  with ten assigned interfaces stays within the overlay apply latency of plan §3.10 (or the reads are reduced further,
  for example by keeping which interfaces carried a tree at the last apply).
- Needs maintainer: no
- Effort: S
